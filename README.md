A Flutter app for storing and managing receipts, warranties, return/exchange deadlines, and subscription renewals — with local reminders before anything expires.

**Local-first** — all data lives on the device in Hive. No login, no cloud, fully offline.

---

## Architecture

Clean Architecture with feature-based folders. Each feature has three layers:

```
features/<feature>/
  data/           # Hive models, datasources, repository implementations
  domain/         # Pure entities, repository contracts, use cases
  presentation/   # Cubits, pages, feature-specific widgets
```

State management uses **Cubit** (from `flutter_bloc`). Routing uses **GoRouter** with a `StatefulShellRoute` for the bottom nav. Dependency injection uses **get_it** — wired manually in `lib/core/di/injector.dart`.

## Setting up

### 1. Generate the platform folders

This package ships with `lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`, and permission snippets — but **not** the `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` folders, since those should match your local Flutter SDK version. Generate them with:

```bash
cd maknoon
flutter create . --org com.maknoon --project-name maknoon
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Add platform permissions

**Android** — open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and merge the contents of `android/PERMISSIONS_SNIPPET.xml` into it (the snippet shows exactly where each block goes).

**iOS** — open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the keys from `ios/PERMISSIONS_SNIPPET.plist`.

### 3. Set Android `minSdkVersion`

In `android/app/build.gradle`, make sure:

```gradle
minSdkVersion 21
```

`flutter_local_notifications` requires at least 21.

### 4. Run

```bash
flutter run
```

## Packages used

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flutter_bloc` + `equatable` | State management (Cubits) |
| `go_router` | Declarative routing with bottom-nav shell |
| `get_it` | Dependency injection |
| `hive` + `hive_flutter` | Local key-value DB for receipts/warranties/subscriptions |
| `path_provider` | App documents directory for stored images |
| `flutter_local_notifications` + `timezone` | Reminders before deadlines |
| `image_picker` | Camera + gallery access for receipt/warranty photos |
| `intl` | Arabic date and number formatting |
| `uuid` | Stable IDs for entities |

---

## How reminders work

When a receipt/warranty/subscription is saved, the relevant `ScheduleReminders…` use case is called. It:

1. Cancels any previously scheduled notifications for that entity ID.
2. Schedules new notifications via `NotificationService.schedule(...)`.

Reminder windows:

- **Receipts** — 3 days before & day-of for both return and exchange deadlines.
- **Warranties** — 30 days, 7 days, and day-of before expiry.
- **Subscriptions** — 3 days and day-of before renewal.

Notification IDs are stable hashes of `(entityId, tag)` so re-scheduling cleanly replaces old reminders.

## Optional: custom Arabic font

The theme references `IBMPlexSansArabic`. To use it:

1. Download the family from [Google Fonts → IBM Plex Sans Arabic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans+Arabic).
2. Drop the `.ttf` files into `assets/fonts/`.
3. Add this block to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: IBMPlexSansArabic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/IBMPlexSansArabic-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/IBMPlexSansArabic-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/IBMPlexSansArabic-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
```

If you skip this, the app will fall back to the system Arabic font — still looks fine.

## What's next

Logical extensions that aren't in this v1:

- Search & filtering on receipts/warranties.
- Categories or tags on receipts (groceries, electronics, etc.).
- CSV export of all data.
- Encrypted Hive boxes (a passphrase to unlock the app).
- Optional cloud backup (Firebase or Supabase) — keeping the same domain layer means you only swap the repository implementation.
